In agriculture, 80% of Kenya is arid and semi-arid land
and only 10% is arable.
DigiFarm is an integrated mobile platform that offers
farmers convenient, one-stop access to a suite of

Operational Excellence
Technology Enabling a Digital Society
It’s not just about providing the bare minimum in voice,
messaging and data services; it’s about investing in
enablers that allow our customers to stay connected to
each other and to the world around them.
Digital First
Rethinking and digitising our operations, products and
services to become more agile in order to enable the
digital lifestyles of our customers.
Cost Transformation
Structurally transform our operating model and
fundamentally reshape our cost base, while also
improving the overall experience for our customers and
generating incremental value.
Our People and Culture
People with the right culture are fundamental to every
aspect of our ambition to be a purpose led, digital
solutions provider. We are bringing together the right
people and skills to scale up and accelerate our digital
transformation.
Our Sustainable Business
We are a purpose driven brand with a deserved
reputation for leadership in driving social progress
through sustainable transformational solutions. Overview
Last year was a challenging one
for businesses around the country.
Despite reported positive economic
growth, consumer wallets remained
under pressure, forcing Kenyans to
make tougher spending decisions
every day.
This lower discretionary spending,
coupled with increased tax demands
as the Government sought to raise
more funds from the ICT sub-sector,
contributed towards the plateauing
in growth of a number of services
including voice and messaging.
Despite this, the service industry
continued to register sturdy
performance, supported by the
growth of businesses such as ours
in ICT, as well as wholesale and retail
trade, transport, tourism and real
estate.
Sustaining Growth
Through Supportive
Regulation
As mobile penetration has deepened
to reach close to 51 million subscribers
in a country of about 52 million, so has
the need to find alternative means
of sustaining growth. Traditional
growth drivers (voice and messaging)
continue plateauing, pointing to the
urgency of reinventing our business
to meet changing consumer needs.
This will require more calculated
investment and innovation, both of which can only succeed in a
supportive regulatory environment.
We have noted with concern,
attempts to regulate the industry
through proposed legislation and
regulations that seek to forcefully
reorganise the operating structure
of companies such as ours, whose
growth has been the result of
well-executed business strategy.
Such actions would severely limit the
ability of businesses to invest, innovate
and transform lives, which is what
Safaricom exists to do. It is our hope
that this matter will be handled in a
more consultative manner, including
meaningful discussions between all
concerned parties in order to come
to a more considered outcome, that's
beneficial to all stakeholders.
Welcoming Competition
Kenya is a dynamic market, with
enough room for multiple players
to compete fairly in the pursuit of
business growth and brand love.
It is therefore encouraging to see the
competition landscape changing,
owing to the ongoing merger
between two market players. We
believe this will result in greater
innovation and efficiencies for the
benefit of customers. Safaricom
welcomes fair competition on a fair
playing ground, where investment,
strategy, innovation and brand
promise are the true differentiators; Connecting People,
Transforming Lives
Over the last 18 years, Safaricom has
built a business founded on our innate
desire to transform lives using mobile
technology. We have been able to
do this by focusing on our strategy,
continuously anticipating the needs of
our customers and innovating to meet
them and staying true to our purpose.
However, none of this would
have been possible without your
unwavering belief in our vision.
So on behalf of the Board of Directors,
I would like to say, thank you. Your
patience, loyalty and support inspire
us to do more: to seek out new growth
opportunities that will generate
considerable shareholder wealth,
and deliver shared value to a broader
stakeholder base.The foundation of our growth is the sustained investment we make centered around customer experience. We have continued
investing heavily and strategically in 4G and now have more than 5,000 sites. Our fibre roll out now covers more than 6,700kms
opening up opportunities for content, smart home and enterprise propositions in the
medium term.
We strive to complement the quality of network experience with personalised products and pricing offers resulting in
customers getting much more to use by paying a little more.
These personalised offers drove reduction of our average rate for data and voice (outgoing) by 42% and 10% respectively.
Average rate per megabyte is down 67% over the last four years as we focus on improving the value we offer to our customers.
Our overall customer growth momentum remained solid, with close to 2.3 million more subscribers joining Safaricom
in the year.Our Revenue Drivers
M-PESA now contributes 31.2% of
service revenue while mobile data
is now contributing 16% there by
reducing the reliance on voice and
messaging revenues. Fixed data
contributed 0.7ppts of the 7% service
revenue growth. Though a relatively
new line of business, fixed data is now
contributing 3.4% of service revenue.
We have over the years successfully
managed to expand the portfolio
which builds resilience and strength
to our business model.
Our Costs
We have achieved significant results
in limiting cost growth by focusing
on digitising and driving efficiencies.
The company now has a cost culture
which helps maximise returns.
Thanks to some strong cost controls
and capex monetisation, underlying
EBIT margin improved by 1.9ppts and
capex intensity improved by 0.7ppts
respectively on an underlying basis.
Effective and efficient capex
investment has been complimented
by successful commercial
monetisation and revenue growth.
As a result, despite increasing capex
investments, capex intensity has
reduced. This has resulted in superior
shareholder returns.
Our resulting strong cash flow helps
us to maintain a high level of capital
re-investment, primarily in our
network infrastructure to maintain a
leading position in network coverage,
call quality and data speed in the market. We have also focused capital
spend on our new billing system as
we look forward to a transformative
digital company.
In addition to investing in the future
prosperity of the business, cash
generated from our business allows
us to maintain our progressive
shareholder returns, guided by our
dividend policy of paying dividends
each year out of net income reported
in that specific yearWe have achieved
significant results in
limiting cost growth
by focusing on
digitising and driving
efficiencies. The
company now has
a cost culture which
helps maximise the
returnsOur Investment Case
The ‘Bulls’ - upside in our
performance
• Strong management execution
• Adoption of 9 SDGs
• Diversified portfolio that does not
over index on one revenue stream
• Solid capital allocation and
improving capital intensity
• Strong network investment
• Pipeline of new revenue streams
including new M-PESA use cases,
E-Commerce, DigiFarm and regional
expansion
• Sustained data growth potential,
indicating future growth
opportunities
• Significant fibre and enterprise
opportunity realised over the past
year to supplement growth
• Strong balance sheet capacity
and cash flow generation, to
support both dividend and future
acquisitions
The ‘Bears’ - downside risk to
our performance
• Concerns on implementation of the
competition study remedies
• Government fiscal deficit and tax
agenda
• Enhanced competition in the
market targeting mobile dataFY19 performance and
influence of taxation and
competition
In a year that macro weighed on
customer choice, we continued
to generate positive momentum
resulting in strong performance in
the year.
Service revenue grew at a strong
rate of 7%, with 5% of the growth
coming from increased customer
support and overall customer growth
momentum remaining solid, pushing
the subscriber base to 31.8 million,
with 2% of the uptick coming from
Average Rate Per User (ARPU) growth.
Customer growth was driven largely
by an effort to regain our customer
trust leading to an improvement in
our NPS.
M-PESA grew 19.2% contributing to
76.6% of service revenue growth and
offsetting a decline in legacy voice
and messaging as these businesses
face competitive pressures and
migration to newer technologies.
M-PESA now accounts for 31.2%
of service revenue, indicating the
resilience in our business model vis
a vis a traditional telco. Voice and
messaging now contribute 39.9% and
7.3% to service revenue respectively.
Mobile data experienced slow
growth at 6.4% contributing 1% to
service revenue growth. It accounts
for 16.1% of service revenue. Mobiledata performance reflects both
competitive conditions in the market
and increased taxation that was
absorbed for in-bundle customers.
Fixed data grew at 22.7% contributing
to 0.7% of service revenue growth and
is now 3.4% of service revenue.
We delivered an EBIT of KShs 89.6b
which is higher than our guidance
of KShs 85billion - KShs 89billion
improving by 13.1%. Earnings per share
improved by 14.7% and free cash flow
improved by 13.9%.
Sustained margin
improvement
EBIT margins improved by 1.9ppts
supported by higher revenue, an
improved contribution margin,
prudent spend and capex investments
leading to increased efficiencies and
improved bottom line. Contribution
margin reflects decreasing airtime
commission driven by more M-PESA
top-ups, M-PESA mix benefit as
M-PESA commission grows at a
slower rate to M-PESA revenue and
other costs benefits.
Investment guidance
for the short to medium
term
We sustained our level of investment
in FY19, with capital expenditure
totaling KShs 37.25billion for the
year. This enabled us to expand our
network to ensure the widest reach.Our capital additions of KShs
37.25billion expressed as a percentage
of our revenues remained in the
‘mid-teens’, driven by our focus
on enhancing monetisation and
cost savings opportunities upon
deployment. We expect similar levels
of capex investment in FY 2020 in
the range of KShs 36-39billion. This
will go into strengthening our mobile
network and supporting our growth
in fixed line as we look to further grow
our Fibre To The Home and Fibre To
The Buisness revenue streams.
Innovation and
partnerships
Innovation and partnerships continue
to define our approach to revenue
diversification and growth. This year,
we made good progress by securing
key partnerships for our M-PESA
business including AliExpress to drive
our payments business, Western
Union to drive remittances and
“Fuliza”, our overdraft product, to drive
lending.
Special dividend and
sustaining shareholder
returns
The Board remains committed
to investing in the business and
continuing our strong record for
paying progressive dividends each
year. The proposed dividend for FY19 is
KShs 50.08billion, an increase of 13.6%
year on year. Given the strong positionof the balance sheet, we proposed a
special dividend for this year of
KShs 24.84billion .
Adoption of IFRS 15/16
standards
During FY19, we have adopted
the IFRS 15 accounting standard
(which primarily relates to revenue
recognition) for our statutory
reporting, but our management
reporting remained on an IAS 18 basis,
reflecting our internal budgeting
process. For FY20, we shall adopt IFRS
15 for our management reporting.
Adoption of IFRS 16 in this financial
year will have a material impact on
EBITDA, mainly due to the leases we
hold. However, the upside on EBITDA
is negated by an increase in both
depreciation and interest expenses,
hence we expect the impact to net
income to be immaterial.
Looking ahead, what
does the future for
Safaricom look like?
We remain committed to our
purpose of transforming lives. Our
latest True Value Report indicates
that Safaricom’s value to the Kenyan
society increased by 11% to KShs 601
billion and contributed 6.3% to the
GDP.
We are excited about the future
of M-PESA expansion and
initiatives such as bringing the
IP to Africa, innovations such as
Fuliza, opportunities around Fibre
including surveillance and content,
E-commerce, DigiFarm and Enterprise
solutions including IoT (Internet of
Things). We continue to leverage the
power of mobile technology to deliver
on shared value propositions that
disrupt inefficiencies and impact lives
positively in the health, agriculture
and education sectors, such as M-Tiba,DigiFarm, Shupavu and M-Salama.
We continued to enhance customer
engagement through capacity
upgrade of our transactions, agents
and merchants in our network. We
remain focused on enhancing our
customer experience to maintain
leadership as the most trusted
company and grow our customer
base.
We are pleased with the strong
results we have delivered for the year,
building on our long track record
of consistent delivery, protecting
shareholder wealth and putting
the customer first and we foresee
continued growth in the future.
Looking ahead, the business will
sustain its momentum of investing
in the quality of our service and
diversification of our revenue portfolio
to ensure sustained returns to
shareholders.
Our financial outlook for 2020 reflects
the adoption of the IFRS 15 and IFRS
16 accounting standards. Guidance on
EBIT is in the KShs 93-97billion range
for FY20 up from KShs 89billion, with
capex guidance remaining within the
KShs 36-39billion rangefundamentally reshape our cost base, while also improving
the overall experience for our customers and generating
incremental value.

Our People and Culture
People with the right culture are fundamental to every
aspect of our ambition to be a purpose led, digital solutions
provider. We are bringing together the right people and
skills to scale up and accelerate our digital transformation.
Our Sustainable Business
We are a purpose driven brand with a deserved reputation
for leadership in driving social progress through sustainable
transformational solutions.C) M-PESA
P2P and new business drives
growth
Telcos the world over have barely
scratched the surface of mobile
money. With only 866 million
registered accounts in 90 countries
and US$1.3 billion transacted every
day, there is still an opportunity to
achieve more.
M-PESA, our mobile money platform
grew by 19.2% in FY19. The growth can
be attributed to an increased number
of users, higher velocity of funds
within the ecosystem and adoption
of new use cases. In FY19, we added
2.1 million active M-PESA customers.
M-PESA now accounts for 31.2% of
service revenue, further accelerating
displacement of our legacy business.
Partnerships
Keeping M-PESA dynamic and
revolutionary has brought the need
for innovation and partnerships in
order to raise the mobile money
bar M-PESA has set over the years.
We sought to open the world to
our customers thus M-PESA Global.
Giving our customers the ability to
send money and make purchases far
beyond the Kenyan borders.
To facilitate M-PESA Global, we
partnered with PayPal, Google
Playstore, Western Union and
AliExpress. Through PayPal, our
customers make +11K transactions
monthly, +5.2k monthly apps
purchase through Google Playstore
and through Western Union our
customers can send money to +500k
cash agents and +3b bank accounts
worldwide.2. Growing Fibre
Monetisation to Core
Business
High deployment costs and low
consumer spending power means
that fibre expansion into the wider
Sub-Saharan Africa region will be a
long-term investment for operators,
with mobile broadband set to remain
the key driver of internet penetration
in the region.
In line with our mission to digitise
Kenya, our fixed infrastructure
strategy aims to increase partnerships
to achieve the widest coverage at the
most attractive economic cost for our
customers.
The business continues to extend the
reach of fibre now passing nearly 300k
homes and more than 2k buildings.
A) Fibre To The Business (FTTB)
In FY19, we achieved 2.4k fibre ready
buildings, a +24% growth in the year
with 6.8k enterprises enjoying FTTB
across 19 towns. We have established
tiered pricing for the different
customer profiles. For small and
medium enterprises, the entry price is
KShs 5,000 while for large enterprises,
the entry price is KShs 15,000.In order to enable the digital lifestyles
of our customers, we embarked on
a digital transformation journey,
rethinking and digitising our
operations, products and services. We
relied on over eight weeks of analysis,
input and design consultations to
develop an operating model that will
facilitate this transformation.
The key areas of focus for Tech 3.0 are:
• Analytics and automation
• Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs) in networks and IT
• Embedding customer security in our
products and technologies
• Fostering a data-driven and
innovative collaborative culture
Beginning in 2019, 60 members of
staff attended our Digital Academy,
undergoing six months of full-time
digital skills training at Strathmore
University.
The operations that we have
embarked on digitising include:
marketing, customer care and sales
which have been aligned to new
digital models. Some of the outcomes
include more emphasise on online
marketing as more and more of our
customers are online; enhanced usage
of self-service channels including
mySafaricom App (+700k daily users),
Voice Biometrics (+1.5m enrollment),
Chatbot (102k unique users) and
launch of sales force automation
in over 200k outlets. All these have
ensured agile ways of working.
We are in the business of transforming
lives by providing customers with end
to end digital solutions from when
they wake up to when they go to bed
through enriching our ecosystem
with platforms such as Masoko,
DigiFarm, M-PESA, Home Solutions,
mySafaricom App and partnerships
with taxis.
Enablers of Digital
Transformation
To execute this strategy, we came
up with our 4Ps – Platform, People,
Process and Performance. To enable
automation we are working with
the following platforms: Digital
Experience Layer – for mining of big
data; Data Management Platform – for
digitising the marketing, customer
care and sales operations and robotic
process automation. People play a key
role in enabling digital transformation.
We have executed the agile way of
working by growing our squads from
5 to 34. A squad is a cross-functional,
self-managed and empowered team
working within 2-week sprints. This
has effectively improved the workflow
within Safaricom.
We have simplified our existing
processes through automation.
In the case of customer service,
this has enabled response to and
resolving customer queries faster,
freeing up our agents for higher value
engagements including cross selling
of products to customers. Automation
has also led to enhanced cost
optimisation and profit maximisation
through improved performance,
increasing our customer base and
delivering value to our shareholders.
Capex Intensity
Our continued focus on enhancing
monetisation has enabled us achieve
mid-teens capex intensity.
While this continues to reduce each
year, it remains above industry
standards as we strive to provide the
best technology to our customers.
We experienced greater monetisation
of capital expenditure increasing
revenue year on year. Our capital
additions of KShs 37.25billion,
expressed as a percentage of our
revenues remained in the ‘mid-teens’,
driven by our focus on enhancing
monetisation and cost savings
opportunities upon deployment.
Opex Intensity
Benefits of cost optimisation also
trickled down operating costs, with
opex intensity improving by 0.2ppts
in FY19.
2With the platueing of traditional revenue streams, we have found it necessary to constantly redefine our focus, in order to tap
into opportunities and position our business as a digital services provider to continue to deliver great value to our customers,
while at the same time protecting shareholder value.
Looking ahead, the business will sustain its momentum of investing in the quality of our service and diversification of our
revenue portfolio to ensure sustained returns to shareholders. This section responds to some of the questions by investors on
Safaricom's strategy.Leveraging and
monetising Big Data and
Analytics and the role
they play in our digital
lifestyle enabler agenda.
Big Data and Analytics give us an
excellent understanding of our
customers, helping us to be more
proactive and customer-focused and
allowing for development of Big-Data
informed solutions.
Financial and CVM products such as
Fuliza, Tunukiwa and Stori Ibambe are
some of the successful products that
have been developed in this light.
We are leveraging the Vodacom group
support for CVM driven initiatives and
propositions.
Big-Data has also guided us in
identifying the value at stake and in
embedding the culture of customer
focused data and informed insights,
giving us superior knowledge on
services for the future such as
E-commerce and DigiFarm providing
strong competitive advantage.
Using data in the digitisation of
agriculture has been a successful
venture for us. Using DigiFarm, we are
able to provide farmers with necessary
tools in the opening of markets
and improving farmers’ agricultural
knowledge.
Learnings from Big Data and AnalyticsOperating profit (EBIT) for the year increased by 13.06%
attributed to growth in service revenue, cost optimisation
and prudent capital expenditure (CAPEX) investments.
Earnings per share improved by 14.67% Year on Year (YoY)
(13.04% based on IFRS 15) driven by strong operating
performance and free cash flow improved by 13.94% YoY.
The accounting policies adopted in the financial year
ending March 31 2019 are consistent with those followed in
the preparation of the Annual Financial Statements for the

Financial Instruments.
IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 are effective for financial years beginning
on or after January 1 2018.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the modified
retrospective approach. Therefore, the cumulative effect of
adopting IFRS 15 has been recognised as an adjustment to the
opening balance of retained earnings as at April 1 2018, with no
restatement of comparative information.

In the spirit of Nawe Kila Wakati and inspired by everyday
Kenyans who are making a positive impact to those around
them; we continue to partner with communities across the
country to bring 500 community dreams to life. The strategy
focuses on health, education and empowerment and enables
us and our partners to develop new and exciting partnerships
models which brings together philanthropy, strategic
investments, shared value and issue based advocacy for
continued connection with communities.
We officially opened the M-PESA Foundation Academy,
a state of the art, mixed boarding high school providing
learning opportunities for bright and/or talented children
from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. It is driven
by leadership, entrepreneurship, technology and innovation.
Currently the Academy has about 700 learners, 14 from each
of the 47 Counties.
We continue to take our social and moral responsibilityBUSINESS REVIEW (Continued)
We have a clear framework for identifying and managing
risk, both at an operational and strategic level. Our risk
identification and mitigation processes have been designed
to be responsive to the ever-changing environments in which
we operate.
Our risk management framework that is aligned to the ISO
31000, allows us to identify, measure, manage and monitor
strategic and operational risks across the business. The
framework provides our management with a clear line of
sight over risk to enable informed decision making.
We continuously review our risk management framework which
provides the foundation and organizational arrangements
for identifying, treating, reporting, monitoring, reviewing
and continually improving risk management throughout
the organization. The key components of the framework are
outlined below:
We classify our risks into two categories; Strategic and Operational.
The following are the principal risks and related mitigation strategies that receive close management attention:While the economic growth was on rebound in 2018, the
country is still battling increased taxation and inflation as well,
leading to a marginal weakening of the shilling.
The swelling public debt continues to weigh heavily on the
country with the public debt currently at 57.1% of GDP (Central
Bank of Kenya statistics). This has resulted in crowding out of
development and social programmes as huge portions of the
government revenue is taken away from essential services
reducing the disposable incomes and spending power of the
people.
The delayed rainfall leading to drought in some parts of the
country will further erode purchasing power of the people."
2018,"L
ast year was a difficult period for
businesses all over the country.
According to official reports, Kenya’s
economic growth slowed to 4.9 per
cent, fuelled by political uncertainty as
the country dealt with the effects of a
prolonged electioneering period.
During this period the credit market also
recorded its slowest growth in 14 years,
attributed to the interest rate capping and
reduced economic activity. In addition,
consumers bore the brunt of high food
prices occasioned by persistent drought,
which negatively affected agricultural
production and strained household
budgets.
However, despite the depressed economic
performance, Government reports show
that the Information and Communication
sector expanded by 11 per cent in 2017,
supported mainly by growth in the digital
economy, mobile telephony, e-commerce,
and online trading, among others.
On the competition front, we continue to
see a lot of changes expected to generate
excitement in market in coming months.
We have seen the entrance of new telco
and non-telco players into the industry.
These developments present evidence
of a dynamic market, whose biggest
beneficiary is undoubtedly the consumer.
Regulatory environment
Looking at industry regulation, we are
following with great interest changes in
the regulatory environment, which will
continue to be an area of focus for us
as we evaluate our position in light of
recommendations put forward in a draft
industry study commissioned by the
Communications Authority.
The draft competition study proposes a
number of interventions that are of serious
concern to us. These include attempts
to change the rules of the game by
introducing price controls and regulated
infrastructure sharing.
While yet to be approved or implemented,
the fact that these suggestions have been
brought forward is an indication that
we could be heading into an era where
success – rightfully earned through wellstructured market strategy, innovation and
investment – is penalised.Our position is that the market should
be allowed the freedom to regulate itself,
and infrastructure-sharing agreements
negotiated between operators in
commercial terms, as is happening
already.
Introduction of price controls not only run
the risk of players abandoning investment
in their own networks as they wait to
be hosted, they will also eventually hurt
customers and the country’s standing as a
leader in innovation.
Additionally, the recommendations that
Safaricom be required to roll out services
replicable by competitors and limitations
in the creation of targeted promotions will
not only stifle our ability to innovate for our
customers and limit our reach; they also
raise questions over their benefit to the
over 40 million mobile subscribers in the
country – which is what any intervention
by the regulator ought to focus on.
In light of these developments, we
continue to engage the Communications
Authority in pursuit of a more considered
outcome that will lead to a win-win result.
The telecommunications sector in Kenya
is liberal and competitive, and operators
should be left to compete on quality,
price and innovativeness of services.
Attempts to introduce retail price controls
are retrogressive, anti-consumer and
unjustified, and are against the country’s
market economy policy.
Business Outlook
While we engage all our stakeholders,
we will continue to invest in our business,
guided by our brand purpose of
Transforming Lives.
This purpose informs our three-pillar
strategy of putting the customer first,
providing relevant products and services,
and enhancing our operational excellence,
which continues to generate favourable
results.
Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in
delivering on this strategy and growing
our shareholders’ wealth, while at the
same time remaining committed to
the Safaricom Way of being a purposeled, customer-obsessed, insights-driven
business.
It is a long-term strategy that is already
paying off, and one that we believe is
integral to the growth of our business.
Corporate governance
During the year, there were changes to the
board. Mohamed Joosub, Till Streichert
and Linda Muriuki were appointed to the
board. I welcome the new directors and
wish to sincerely thank John Otty and
Nancy Macharia for their contribution
during their tenure on the board.
I am also pleased to welcome our CEO,
Bob Collymore, back to work following his
medical leave of absence. During his time
away, he continued to provide valuable
leadership to the business and work
closely with our Board of Directors and
Executive Committee, which contributed
greatly to the strong performance we
enjoyed last year.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
thank the media, our partners and the
general public for respecting Bob’s privacy
while he was away.
In closing, I would also like to thank the
staff and management of Safaricom for
their continued dedication to our purpose
of transforming lives.
We look forward to another great year
of transforming lives and partnering for
success, for when we come together, great
things happen.Safaricom exists to transform lives.
This is our purpose; the driving
force behind everything we do.
It’s what guides us to deliver our
strategy, which is founded on three pillars:
putting the customer first, delivering
relevant products and services, and
enhancing operational excellence.
In the last year we showcased our
commitment to implementing this
strategy, overcoming economic and
regulatory headwinds to post a strong
financial performance, create great value
for our shareholders and transform the
lives of millions of Kenyans every day.
Within the same year I also took some
much-needed time off to receive specialised
medical treatment. I however continued
to work closely with my Executive Team
through face-to-face meetings in London
and remotely using our Virtual Private
Network as we guided the business
through a rather tough period.
While they handled the day-to-day
business operations, I had time to reflect
on a subject that has become very
dear to me: our company culture.
Safaricom is a high performing organisation
powered by over 6,000 men and women
dedicated to ensuring that we achieve
our brand purpose of transforming lives.
But we often forget to highlight one of
the most critical elements contributing
to our success, and that is people.
These men and women, majority of whom
our shareholders and other stakeholders
never get to interact with, are the secret
ingredient to our success, and the
engine behind our continued growth.
People and Culture
It is through investment in a strong,
competent body of staff that our
business continues to enjoy its position
as the market leader, guided by a
sharp focus on our strategy.
So this year, we will be realigning
and refreshing our corporate culture
to meet our business goals, with
focus on four key elements: purpose,
humanness, growth and trust.
We are on a journey to creating a workplace
that promotes productivity, beginning
by taking care of the needs of people.
We have begun to do this by investing
more in staff wellness through the 100%
Human at Work initiative, which seeks to
encourage businesses to recognise their
staff members as human beings, not just
resources, in order to create a happier,
healthier, more productive workforce.
Having had the time to really reflect on the
role of employee wellness on a business’
performance, I am particularly passionate
about investing in initiatives that will
ensure that we deliver great value for our
shareholders and continue to transform lives.
Diversity and Inclusion
As a business, we have also committed to
pursuing true diversity and inclusion, which
means elevating more women to leadership
positions and absorbing more people living
with disabilities into our organisation.
While we are proud of achieving a 1:1 male
to female employee ratio, there is need to
create more opportunities for more women
to transition into leadership positions.
In line with this, we have committed to
matching the number of women in senior
management to that of men by 2020.
In addition to that we have pledged to
increase the number of staff with disabilities
from the current 1.7 per cent of our employee
population to five per cent by March 2021,
and to work closely with partners to advocate
for the full inclusion of people with disabilities
within the public and private sectors.
Delivering the Strategy
At Safaricom, we like to speak about the 3P’s
that support our strategy: Purpose, People
and Profit – that when you put purpose and
people first, then profit always follows.
It’s a mind-set that has led us to
achieve remarkable results each year,
reminding us that our business exists to
transform lives; from the communities
we serve to the people who serve.
Under the guidance of a strong leadership
team and dedication of our staff, we
diversified the business to support
revenue generated by voice and SMS,
which continued to defy global trends to
report a blended growth of 2.9% YoY.
Despite this performance we remain alive to
the global decline of voice and SMS usage,
and are readying the business by introducing
more innovative products and services.
We see a consumer-led future in data and
mobile money buoyed by the attendant
value propositions that we will continue to
offer our customers. In light of this trend
we are moving towards a more resilientbusiness model that will drive sustained
business growth by leveraging new
opportunities in mobile and fixed data, and
mobile money transfer and payments.
As demand for these services grows,
we are positioning ourselves to tap into
opportunities that arise so that we can
narrow the gaps to accessibility presented
by physical and geographical barriers.
This includes: continued investment in the
expansion of our 4G footprint; provision of fast,
affordable Internet to retail and commercial
customers through Safaricom Business and
Safaricom Home fixed data propositions; and
building partnerships that will enable us offer
high quality, local and international content.
In addition, we continue to explore new
innovations around the latest technologies
built on Internet-based solutions.
The Internet of Things (IoT) presents exciting
new opportunities for us to showcase the
power of collaboration and technology, and
we’ve already began experimenting with
it in the areas of sports and healthcare.
Also leading our growth is M-PESA, which
has maintained a steady momentum to
contribute 28 per cent of our service revenue.
In the last financial year, we maintained
our focus on democratizing M-PESA by
reducing Lipa Na M-PESA merchant fees by
50 per cent, and scrapping transaction fees
for amounts lower than KES 200 in order
to encourage adoption of service, which
we view as a huge untapped opportunity.
We also continue to improve the customer
experience on M-PESA through system
enhancement, additional security
features and mySafaricom App, so as to
ensure the long-term sustainability of
this ecosystem and business stream.
As part of our sustained push to offer
disruptive products and services, we are
also looking forward to delivering success
on Masoko, the e-commerce platform
we launched last year. We intend to do
this by streamlining its operations to
meet market demand and shake up
the local online trading industry.Beyond our borders, we continue to
monitor and explore new areas of
opportunity in keeping with our strategy,
which in 2016 we aligned with the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Sustainable Growth
Aware of the reality that our business cannot
thrive independent of the communities we
operate in, we have adopted and began
to pursue the achievement of nine of the
17 SDGs: Good Health & Wellbeing (Goal
3); Quality Education (Goal 4); Affordable
& Clean Energy (Goal 7); Decent Work
& Economic Growth (Goal 8); Industry,
Innovation & Infrastructure (Goal 9);
Reduced Inequalities (Goal 10); Responsible
Consumption & Production (Goal 12); Peace,
Justice & Strong Institutions (Goal 16) and
Partnerships For The Goals (Goal 17).
These goals represent our commitment
to mobilizing global efforts towards
realising shared prosperity for all, and
present significant opportunities for our
business to make a greater contribution
to equal socio-economic growth.
Guided by the SDGs, we are investing
in initiatives that are transforming lives,
collaborating with partners to deliver
essential services in sectors such as
healthcare, education and agriculture,
and empowering Kenya’s youth.
Looking ahead, we see great opportunities
for sustained growth. One of our goals is
to transform Safaricom into a truly agile
organisation, by creating an environment
where decisions can be made quickly and
mistakes viewed as opportunities to learn fast.
It all begins with investing in our people,
whose job it is to ensure that Safaricom
remains the leading mobile network operator,
and who prove to us every day that when
we come together, great things happen.
Twaweza!Safaricom operates in a very dynamic
market, which we expect to become
even more vibrant as customer needs
evolve and new entrants attempt to
disrupt the status quo.
We see great opportunities to leverage the
power of mobile technology to transform
lives in line with our brand purpose, and
to become the purpose-driven, customer
obsessed and insights-led business we
envision – what we call the Safaricom Way.
With local and global trends pointing to the
decline in use of traditional telco services
such as voice and SMS services, and uptake and e-commerce, we are positioning
ourselves to be the platform of choice that
will deliver relevant products and services.
To do this, we must transform into a truly
agile organisation that is fit for the future.
This is a process that requires us to fine-tune
our approach to ideation and delivery of
products and services. Our goal is to create
an environment where decisions can be
made quickly, and where mistakes are
viewed as opportunities to learn.
Because we view ourselves as more than a telco, we believe that embracing an agile
way of work will enable us feed into a
wider ecosystem, positioning us favourably
to deliver a suite of innovative solutions
in everything from financial services and
education, to healthcare, agriculture and
public services.
By embracing agility, we are learning how to
work faster and smarter, to be more flexible
and quicker to adapt. In the process, we are
also building a more sustainable business
and transforming millions of lives using
the most ubiquitous of devices: the mobile
phone.Over the last 18 years, we have
evolved from a voice and text outfit
to walk the extra mile in the digital
journey in order to deliver cuttingedge products and services to our customers.
We have invested in developing an insight of
our customers’ needs, wants and behaviours,
and are providing propositions to lead in
chosen segments including the Segment of
One.
We have embraced a new level of targeting
and rejected the outdated view of customers
as large, indistinct, and coherent segments.
To tailor offerings to specific customer needs,
we are employing analytical marketing,
mining the Big Data already at our disposal
to respond continually to the behaviour of
individuals and market micro-segments.
We have found this to be cost-effective as
investment can increasingly be channeled
productively, rather than wasted through
overly simplistic assumptions about the
general market.
Powered by data analytics, we are using
segmentation to offer relevant products
cognizant of the reality that each customer
cluster has a different addressable value.
Subscribers constantly connect to our
networks through voice, SMS, M-PESA
and other smartphone interactions, and
hence we have access to huge quantities of
data. Our vision is to manage it effectively.
We now offer value propositions tailored
to each target customer’s needs. We mine
the data we have at the deepest levelpossible in order to deliver our segmentation
proposition to the most granular detail
possible.
We have moved from the aggregate to
the unique customer level in our targeting
efforts. We are identifying pockets of value in
the market in order to better customise their
experience.
We strive to complement the quality of
network experience with personalised
products and pricing offers resulting in
customers getting much more to use by
paying a little more.
These personalised offers drove reduction
of our effective pricing for data and SMS by
29% and 12% respectively, with voice prices
remaining flat. Effective data prices are down
more than 60% over the last four years as we
focus on improving the value we offer to our
customers.We are continuously investing in
our network to ensure that we
deliver world class products
and services on our network in
order to deliver the best experience to the
digital customer.
Sustained investment in our network over
the years has positioned us favourably,
and we will continue to modernize our I.T.
infrastructure to maintain this lead.
The continuous investment in our network
earned us the coveted title of the fastest
mobile network in the country, as affirmed
by renowned speed test provider Ookla. This
is as a result of investing in widening our 4G
network across Kenya, offering our customers
the fastest internet speed in the country.
The investment is laying the groundwork
for transforming ourselves into a digital
companySafaricom Women in Technology
(WIT) is an programme of passionate
women from Safaricom technologydriven divisions dedicated to inspiring
women from different backgrounds to
advance their careers from classroom to
board room. These efforts are geared towards
creating an opportunity to tap into latent
talent and innovative ideas sitting on the
bench with our girls, whilst dynamic trends
continue to emerge in technology. In FY18,
WIT continued in its efforts to promote
technology among learners, working with the
full range of learners, from six year olds to 20
year olds and beyond.
The programme for the youngest band,
6-13 year olds, was Kids-Go-Tech, who were
taught to do a series of fun, simple technical
experiments. There were 24 successful
sessions in which 40 experiments were done.
750 children took part in Kids-Go-Tech.
For this category, WIT plans to hold events
for children in urban informal settlements as
well as extend to the regions..
WIT also carried out its 47/47 High School
programme, where it planned to reach
47 girls’ high schools in all 47 counties in
Kenya with the aim of having them “see and
believe” the reality of technology.
WIT was able to reach 45 counties in FY18,
reaching more than 2000 girls in Marsabit,forums, WIT was able to reach 396 students,
with 12 schools attending sessions in the
Coast region. Follow-up in this area revealed
that girls are fighting to stay in school until
they finish secondary school as education for
boys has more value.
More than 320 students attended the
sessions in Thika and the team was happy to
meet one who had been scoring poor grades
when she attended a similar programme
in Thika two years ago but was inspired to
do better and was now on her way to study
electrical engineering at the university.
The Tech-novation Challenge also targeted
high school students and involved girls’
high schools, with the students required to
submit apps addressing specific problems.
This was a local and continental competition
culminating in an international competition62 apps submitted.
From this, 10 teams were shortlisted for the
2018 Global Tech-novation semis. Kenya was
ranked fourth globally in submission behind
Spain, Canada and US.
WIT also conducted outreach on university
campuses, using visits and in-house
mentorships, hackathons based on the
United Nation’s Sustainable Development
Goals, developers outreach, the Technology
Academy, campus technology careers
workshops, the Graduate Management
Program and BLAZE brand ambassadors.
The programme reached 30 universities,
both local and international and five
university career fairs. It conducted 25
industrial visits and in-house workshops, two
SDG hackathons and collaborated with the
Daraja API team.
WIT was also involved in the Technology
Academy for value-added internship. The
academy has had its sixth intake since
inception and now reserves a quota for
People Living With Disabilities and has
started the uptake of trainers of trainers from
the technology division.
WIT coordinates networking forums and the
target for the next year is to go beyond career
mentorship to balance in the overall holistic
life. I
n the period under review, Safaricom
recognized and celebrated teams and
individuals who embodied Safaricom
way of SPEED, SIMPLICITY AND
TRUST. Through the Safaricom way hero
stories, 15 teams and 9 individuals were
recognized for actively displaying the
Safaricom way as they carried out their
jobs. From this group two staff members
were awarded with an opportunity to visit
Vodafone in the United Kingdom later this
year to attend the Vodafone Customer
Experience event.
Diversity and Inclusion
Our purpose challenges us to look at the
most immediate needs of our society,
and find solutions that transform lives.
Our focus on Diversity and Inclusion is
an intentional effort towards ensuring
inclusivity for all in the community. In
financial year 2017/18, we continued to
embed diversity and inclusion as a way of
life.
During the period under review, we
accelerated efforts to ensure Safaricom
mirrors the communities we serve. The
company continues to position itself
as the employer of choice through four
Interdependent levers of Attraction,
Retention, Growth & Development and
Driving Change.
Gender: Overall, we have maintained
a gender-balanced workforce of 50:50
whilst management has also remained at
68:32 with an ambitious plan to achieve
50:50 by FY 2020/1
Persons with disabilities: 1.7% of our staff
force is composed of persons living withdisabilities. We have an ambitious goal of
increasing this to five per cent by March
2021. Safaricom has so far employed
ninety-six members of staff with various
disabilities including visual and hearing
impairments, paraplegics, and people
living with albinism and dwarfism. Our
desire is to create an employee value
proposition that positions us as an
inclusive, equal opportunity employer, not
because we are required to, but because it
is the right thing to do.
Supporting people living with disability
Our intention is not only to offer
employment opportunities to persons
with disability, but also to ensure that we
provide a condusive working environment
for them to realize their full potential. To
this end, we have gone an extra mile to
enhance our support concerning their
diverse range of requirements specific to
the nature of disability. These includes,
enhanced medical cover, assistive
devices, inclusive physical environment,
emergency response equipment for
persons living with disabilities and
psychosocial support for staff as well
as employees who have children with
disabilities. In addition, we conducted"
